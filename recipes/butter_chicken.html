        <h2> Description</h2>

        <p>
            This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, 
            is one of my favourite Indian dishes. It features a 
            full-flavored sause that complements the chicken well. It
            can be made as mild or spicy as you which by adjusting 
            the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.
